# BinaryReversal Code Challenge

Have the function BinaryReversal(str) take the str parameter being passed, which will be a positive integer, take its binary representation (padded to the nearest N * 8 bits), reverse that string of bits, and then finally return the new reversed string in decimal form. For example: if str is "47" then the binary version of this integer is 101111 but we pad it to be 00101111. Your program should reverse this binary string which then becomes: 11110100 and then finally return the decimal version of this string, which is 244.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

### Prerequisites

JDk 1.8 or higher

### Tech Stack

Java

### COMPILE AND RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE

If you know how to compile programs on the command line, you can easily compile and run all the examples.
For non-GUI programs, just change into one of the directories on which we have the java class
and use a command of the form

                  javac ExampleClassName.java
                  
For example:
                  javac DoBinaryReversal.java

here DoBinaryReversal is class name and filename
                  
As long as your compiler supports Java 8 or higher, there should be no errors.  
(You might see some warnings, especially if you use a newer version of Java, 
but warnings do not stop a program from being compiled or executed.)  You can 
then run the compiled programs using the java command with one argument

For example:

                  java DoBinaryReversal 47
                  
then u can see the output as 244
